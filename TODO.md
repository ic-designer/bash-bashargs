# TODO

1.  Figure out a standard way of pulling dependecies like `waxwing`. It would be cool if you there
    was a shared recipe that provided a way to dynamically create a makefile that cloned the repo,
    built the executables, created standardized variables to access that executable from other
    recipes.
2.  Create standard that describes the following:
    - How to structure bash scripts
    - How scripts are combined to create libraries and executables.
3.  Describe in README how to add bashargs as dependency in a makefile.
